This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

## Issue
During `npm test`, the unit test `Router: App > should navigate to /one` failed with `"Uncaught (in promise): Error: NG0302: The pipe 'currency' could not be found!. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0302"` occurs whereas `npm start` the error doesn't occurr. Something tells me I have to do something with the `Router: App > should navigate to /one` unit test configuation, but I have read and tried several suggestions found on Internet with no success.
